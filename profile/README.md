<p align=center><i> ⬤ Reducing the impact that brain disorders have on children’s lives ⬤ </i></p> 

### Welcome to DECODE

The human brain is one of nature’s most amazing creations - a complex network that powers our thoughts, movements, and creativity. Yet, when the brain develops differently than expected, it can lead to serious disorders in children that affect their everyday lives. These conditions are often linked to subtle changes in brain structure and genetic makeup, and until now, they have remained a mystery to scientists.

### Our Mission

DECODE (Dissecting Etiology of Cerebellar Origins of Disorders in Early childhood) is a groundbreaking project that uses the latest advances in molecular profiling and genetic research to uncover the origins of these developmental disorders. Our work lays the foundation for future treatments and drug development, offering hope for a better quality of life for affected children.

### A Global Collaboration

This project is a proud collaboration between experts in computational data analysis in Germany and developmental neuroscience in Korea. By combining the unique strengths of both teams - led by early career researcher Naveed Ishaque in Germany and Sohyon Lee in South Korea - we are taking innovative steps to bridge critical gaps in our understanding of brain development. Although DECODE is in its early stages, we are actively seeking support to help us transform these insights into real-world solutions that reduce the burden of childhood brain disorders.

*Join us on our journey to decode the secrets of the developing brain and build a healthier future for children everywhere*
